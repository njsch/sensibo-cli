## A Command-line Client for Sensibo Hardware Devices.

## Introduction
This little applet is something I made in response to the observation that &ndash; as of this writing &ndash; even though the Sensibo iPHone app is more-or-less accessible to vision-related screen-reading technologies, the graphical interface tended to jump around the place a lot and some buttons were not labeled properly. Consequently, I decided to take advantage of the existing and open API to hopefully make things a little easier.

## Operation
Program functions are performed by typing commands that the computer responds to. They are as follows:

* To quit the program, simply type &ldquo;exit&rdquo; or &ldquo;quit&rdquo;.
